# üíªüìù SAMU-Logistics

**SAMU-Logistics** is a desktop application designed to streamline the paperwork process. It allows users to input customer data such as name, address, and bank details, and auto-fills the rest of the form fields based on the stored information. The app also enables printing the completed form on A4 paper for official documentation.

## Features

- **Auto-fill Forms**: Enter key customer details, and the rest of the form is automatically populated.
  - Example: Enter customer name, and fields like address, bank account, date, etc., will auto-fill.

- **Customer Management**: Add and store customer information in the MySQL database.
  - Manage customer data like name, address, bank account, and more.
  
- **Customizable Forms**: Add and customize forms for different business needs.

- **Printing**: Print the completed form on A4 paper for official use.

- **Efficient Workflow**: Speeds up paperwork, reducing manual data entry.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive UI for easy data input and form management.

- **Desktop Icon**: After installation, the app creates a desktop icon for easy access.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js  
- **Backend**: Express.js  
- **Database**: MySQL (used to store customer data and form templates)

## How It Works

1. **Add New Customer**: Input a customer's information (e.g., name, address, bank account, etc.) into the app.
2. **Store in MySQL**: The customer data is stored in the MySQL database.
3. **Auto-fill Forms**: When filling out a form, select the customer, and the app auto-fills the form with the stored data (address, name, bank details, etc.).
4. **Generate and Print**: Once the form is completed, the user can view and print it in A4 format.
5. **Desktop Icon**: The app will automatically add a shortcut to your desktop for quick access.

## Future Enhancements

- Add more complex form templates for various industries.
- Enable users to save and manage multiple completed forms.
- Integrate with third-party services to auto-populate forms (e.g., government or bank databases).
- Add PDF export functionality for easy submission of forms.
